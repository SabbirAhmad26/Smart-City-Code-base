All codes are in simulation folder.

simulation_path.py is for controlling the robot by predetermined path with a list of points. Points' coordinates can be obtained by running lane.py and then clicking on the intersection

simulation_input.py is for control by user's inputs (angle and velocity in USEREVENT). 

Files with _e.py are for extended intersection
