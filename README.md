spline.py: polynomial trajectory calculation (input = array of (x,y))

lane.py:  print(x,y) locations and move the car to the clicked points (uncomment car.move())

test2.py: cars move with given angle and velocity

test.py: car moves with polynomial trajectory. Currently working on this one, a problem is the car spins around when it gets to the 1st point
